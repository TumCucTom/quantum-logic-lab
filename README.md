## Features

### 1. Quantum Circuit Builder
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Design quantum circuits visually by dragging and connecting quantum gates (e.g., Hadamard, CNOT, Pauli gates).
- **Customizable Circuits**: Configure parameters like the number of qubits and gate actions.

### 2. Simulation Engine
- **Backend Simulations**: Powered by Qiskit or Cirq, the simulator runs your designed circuits seamlessly.
- **Teleportation Protocol**: Simulate advanced quantum phenomena, such as quantum state teleportation, and experiment with fidelity improvements using multiple entangled pairs.

### 3. Visualization Tools
- **Quantum State Representation**: 2D and 3D visualizations, including Bloch spheres and density matrices.
- **Entanglement Visualization**: See the effects of entanglement on your circuits.
- **Fidelity Tracker**: Real-time graphing of teleportation fidelity improvements as entanglement increases.

### 4. Export and Import
- **Circuit Export**: Save your circuits in standard formats like QASM or JSON.
- **Import Compatibility**: Load saved circuits into other quantum simulators or hardware environments.
